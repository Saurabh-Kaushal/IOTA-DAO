# IOTA DAO Pioneers

We took inspiration from [Stephen Reid](http://stephenreid.net/) ([@daoist321](https://twitter.com/daoist321)) How to DAO course, but harmonized content and adjusted it to the needs of our IOTA community.


## Session 3 prep

Listen in to this great podcast episode on Spotify about reward systems in DAOs.

"At the start of the epoch, each Circle member receives a number of non-divisible GIVE tokens. Members allocated their GIVE tokens to other members over the course of the epoch to reward them for their value to the organization. Members can adjust their allocations up until the end of the epoch. They can add notes to their allocations if they wish. At the end of the epoch, all allocated GIVE tokens become locked (now called GET tokens), and all unallocated GIVE tokens are burned. Budget distribution is then formulated according to the percentage of total GET tokens that each member of the circles has received."

### Tally

Today at Tally, we build tools and interfaces to scale decentralized decision-making. We have tools to vote, see who is participating in governance, and understand what votes and proposals are available. We support protocols looking to launch on-chain governance with an interface for creating and managing proposals. We help tokenholders keep up with governance via email notifications and to gather delegations and support from their fellow holders.
