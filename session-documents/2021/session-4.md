Bankless started in 2019 as a newsletter, added a podcast in 2020, and in 2021 is now a self-sustaining media company dedicated to democratizing access to information about the world of decentralized finance. The role of Bankless is to operate as a public good for education, media, and culture on crypto and all other bankless technologies that are being introduced into the world.


## **Mission statement: [Mission (bankless.community)](https://www.bankless.community/mission)**


### **The bankless movement is ready to grow out of the hands of the few and into the hands of the many.**

*The bankless message is a global banner, and the Bankless DAO is the organization that coordinates people under this banner. Only an internet-native organization is capable of growing an internet-scaled revolution, and thus we need a Bankless DAO to grow the bankless revolution.*

*We want a money system by the people and for the people.*

*We want to propagate crypto media and culture.*

*We want to help the world go bankless.*

*Help grow the world’s first-ever media and culture DAO. Bring your talents, time, and ideas. Join the revolution.*

**Season Plan**

The Season Plan is a cyclical schedule for BankessDAO’s development and financial planning. Each season lasts for three months, parallel to the natural quarter in reality, and progresses at a fixed pace.

The purpose of the season is to define collective priorities, gather energy, and increase clarity; Season is also important in terms of community incentives and economic systems. At the beginning of each season, a budget is allocated, and funding is provided for four different types of activities (this part is more important and longer, so it will be analyzed in detail in the third section on the economic system)

Bankless DAO is organized into 13 [guilds](https://www.notion.so/bankless/What-are-Guilds-and-How-do-I-Join-480beb1cdd35401d97b6d93ef6cf46ec). These guilds are talent pools and represent different competencies available for other members of the DAO to join or tap into—writers, developers, analytics, design, legal, etc.

Each guild has its own [budget](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/QmeUcnL5FTpF2ah2CCph6DZGqJzG19coT9b3ECLAvBxPH2) to allocate as they see fit.

Guilds quickly grasped the advantage of having their own capital pools instead of relying on a central flow from the grants committee and have begun to find ways to bring capital flows into their multisigs.

So far, we’ve already seen the marketing guild standardize pricing for Twitter campaigns.


<img width="506" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893790-510b0808-c0b8-4498-9c06-24046d30fdcb.png">


Thinking further along here, DAOs as economic engines are a useful framing for rethinking [cost centers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-center.asp) with an organization. Take, for example, _First Quest_. First Quest is Bankless DAO’s onboarding project.

Members drop into the Discord server and go through a series of “quests” that briefly contextualizes Bankless DAO’s mission, culture, tools, and operations.


<img width="514" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893804-3e54b96d-134d-460b-9356-8b7e25d2e1db.png">
<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893816-d2e41f6c-ada9-4b97-b516-82d5d82d1230.png">
Discord onboarding in Bankless DAO

Eventually, going through _First Quest _will lead directly to a guild workstream. Like a funnel with multiple outlets, new members can find a guild they most resonate with and jump directly into a guild-specific first quest. For example, the [writers guild’s first quest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmaoGRhFlK6jdfkE8pZtn1LmqVSzpwxFlHvpZ-xDaEI/edit#) would be to complete an editing or writing task to gauge competency and familiarize new members with how the writers guild operates.


<img width="499" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893833-8b5da597-f3f8-4323-ac00-4d45a0b4ec5f.png">



Let’s take the Writers’ Union as an example. This is a group of writers who continuously output articles or organize newsletters according to the needs of the DAO. But they’re not satisfied with just that, and they’ve been working on all kinds of things. Recently, for example, they’ve been putting together articles for Argent Wallet’s DeFi feature page, charging per article. You read that right, these guys are out getting work -_-


### Unions 
Since the vast majority of members are part-time, almost all roles are shared by multiple individuals. The union is the most active presence in the entire DAO. Most of the operating union members have a high level of authority throughout the DAO. Still, this authority does not come from a power structure defined by rules, but from their professionalism, understanding, and familiarity with the DAO, their significant time commitment, and the constant help they give to their members.

The operating union is actually equal to the management support and back-office support of the entire DAO. This part of the responsibility also exists in the form of a union, which also follows the standard union rules and is open to all to join.

The specific responsibilities of the Operations Union include:



* Coordinating the day-to-day affairs and ensuring that the entire DAO runs smoothly and with a common goal.
* Overseeing the day-to-day activities of the DAO and keeping everyone aligned with the vision
* Facilitating the smooth and rapid functioning of all other aspects of DAO’s capabilities
* Facilitate core operations, people, budgets and goals, project delivery, and strategy
* Supports all of DAO’s functions working together


#### **Decentralization and Resilience**

The main benefit of moving from centralized to decentralized capital flows is… decentralization! Creating an economic engine will ultimately reduce reliance on centralized intermediaries, like a grants committee.

Transitioning to distributed capital flows also creates a resilient economic structure that is not reliant on a centralized source of funding and is susceptible to corruption, bottlenecks, and inefficient practices. 

As an added benefit, each instance of distributing capital to smaller pools, such as to each of the 13 guilds, creates experiments that run in parallel. Each guild has evolved to use their capital pools in their own ways, and the best practices have cross-pollinated, which further increases resilience across the DAO.





## Aave Grants DAO



* [Aave Grants DAO | Aave Improvement Proposals](https://aave.github.io/aip/AIP-17/)
* [Aave Ecosystem Grants. Today we’re announcing the launch of… | by David Truong | Aave Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/aave/aave-ecosystem-grants-88260ede1485)
* [Aave Ecosystem Grants, Round 2. TL;DR: We’re continuing the Aave… | by David Truong | Aave Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/aave/aave-ecosystem-grants-round-2-33e7ffed7933)
* [Latest Aave Grants DAO topics - Aave](https://governance.aave.com/c/developers/25)

Aave has an ecosystem reserve of $1.2B or 2.7m AAVE as of 4/27/21, which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which could be used to fund grants. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals.

To promote inclusivity and a more visible and transparent avenue for funding development in the Aave ecosystem while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, we propose a community-led grants program called Aave Grants DAO.

The goal of the program is to provide resources to grow the Aave ecosystem in a way that can scale over time. There are many great ideas for improving the Aave protocol bubbling up in the Discord, community forum, and other places. We hope to initiate a community-led, transparent process for connecting those developers/creators/innovators with the resources needed to go from idea to funded development.

Given the difficulty of decentralizing grants administration, we propose establishing a committee that can administer grants on a discretionary basis. The focus will be on disbursing grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to improve the Aave ecosystem.

We propose a committee of 8 members: 1 lead and 7 reviewers. The lead will be the organizational backbone of the program and ensure that things move smoothly and efficiently. The lead will likely dedicate a significant amount of time to the program.

Reviewers will process applications, ensure that the lead is acting in good faith and is effective in their role, and will operate a 4 of 7 multisig which disburses funds to grantees. The reviewers will also hold the program accountable to its goals and objectives and return any excess funds to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Reviewers are likely to dedicate a smaller amount of time to the program.


### **Budget**

We request a max grants budget of $2m to distribute grants and a max operating budget of $250k over two quarters to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. This will be funded by the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.

Payments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made at the end of every month (i.e., if the program begins on 4/30/21, the lead will be paid on 5/30/21, and then again 6/30/21 and 7/30/21 based on hours worked). Payments to reviewers will also be made every month based on hours worked.

Any changes to the AGD, including renewal of the program at the end of 2 quarters, total quarterly budget, and committee compensation, will require a full quorum.


### **Committee Compensation**

We suggest compensation for the lead roughly in line with the initial Uniswap and Compound proposals - $100/hr for a maximum of 40 hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the AGD multisig from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve as part of the overall funding for the program.

The time commitment for the reviewers is likely to be far lower. The compensation for reviewers will be $100/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.


### **Priorities**

To help inform the types of grants which are most likely to get funded, we highlight the following target areas:



1. Protocol development (including core Aave protocol development, development of higher-layer protocols that use the Aave protocol)
2. Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications that use the Aave protocol)
3. Developer tooling
4. Community (marketing and educational)
5. Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem
6. Code audits
7. Events and hackathons
8. Bounties

### MakerDAO Ponders the Unthinkable as Members Debate Incorporation and Paying Taxes

Should DAOs pay taxes? And, if so: Where?

There’s a conversation underway in MakerDAO about how it should relate to the governments of the world, which has implications for the whole DeFi industry. In short, people are talking about whether or not MakerDAO should find a way to pay its taxes.

“I don’t think anyone here has the money to pay the IRS if they decide that Maker is a U.S. entity and decide to treat as income the $400+ million batch of tokens provided by the Foundation,” pseudonymous MakerDAO forum user PaperImperium [wrote](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-the-dao-needs-a-serious-discussion-about-legal-structure/10764/21).  

“My understanding is the only way around this is simply that Maker itself meet any claimed obligations,” the user continued.” The first level of compliance is paying taxes — preferably in a single jurisdiction we choose now and not half a dozen that decide they can pick on a stateless DAO.” 


<img width="478" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893946-adf48f7c-ff63-43e3-904e-c29db38b9280.png">



In[ a post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-the-dao-needs-a-serious-discussion-about-legal-structure/10764) that kicked off the conversation for MakerDAO, PaperImperium wrote:

“MakerDAO currently has no legal structure registered in any jurisdiction, notwithstanding the dissolving Maker Foundation and the Dai Foundation. In the U.S., we are almost certainly likely to be classified as a general partnership, which we urgently need an answer for.” 

A general partnership is a legal identity that the U.S. imposes on an organization if it hasn’t otherwise registered itself in another category. PaperImperium finds this arrangement particularly problematic for the MakerDAO in light of potential tax obligations.

“U.S. history has many examples of a single member of a general partnership being forced to pay the entire tax burden of their partners.” 

“Given the current political climate in the U.S., desire to increase spending, and growing worry over how to pay for that, I cannot foresee Maker — which pays taxes exactly nowhere – escaping notice, perhaps in multiple jurisdictions at once,” he wrote.

Wouter Kampmann, team lead from another core unit, chimed in to say that he agreed it was a conversation whose time had come, but he also drew a line in the sand.

“We need to step up our legal strategy efforts,” Kampmann[ wrote](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-the-dao-needs-a-serious-discussion-about-legal-structure/10764/16), but he also wanted to push his colleagues to stick to their principles.” Panic is rarely a good adviser.”


#### Emergency Shutdown

Noting that the digital era already makes total surveillance a reality and a future where most transactions occur with stablecoins only make it more so, he urged his fellow members of the DAO to take a stand for DAI as an alternative.

“For me, there is one important thing we should keep in mind when considering these matters: Any path that leads to legal AML/KYC requirements on the Dai token itself should be a non-starter.”

In fact, if the DAO finds itself forced to add those features, Kampmann suggested the best move would be to trigger [emergency shutdown](https://blog.makerdao.com/introduction-to-emergency-shutdown-in-multi-collateral-dai/) and simply dissolve the project.

## **How can a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) be legally structured?**

Lawyer, lecturer for digitalization law | IOTA Foundation

Will be our guest in the DAO Pioneer call on Friday 03.12.!

## **1. DAOs without a registered legal entity**

The first option, which is used a lot through the DeFi- Ecosystem, is not setting up a legal entity at all and trying to create a fully decentralized structure. However, this does not mean that DAOs without a registered legal entity operating outside the law. They will be seen as general partnerships with the corresponding legal consequences in most jurisdictions. This most significant one is the risk of the personal liability of every participant. But this also means the DAO has a legal personality and can legally own assets and employ people in most jurisdictions. Although the participants did not register the DAO, they created a fully recognized legal entity in most jurisdictions that can sue and can be sued. This is often misunderstood.

Although this bears significant risks, as mentioned. This structure also takes advantage of regulatory arbitrage in certain areas. If no central entity is involved and the project is truly decentralized and launched, anonymous legal enforcement becomes pretty difficult. Even the SEC acknowledged that the greater a project’s decentralization, the less likely the underlying tokens would be considered securities.<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn8”>8</a></sup>


## **2. Setting up a DAO with a liability wrapper or as a DAO LLC**

The second option is setting up a DAO with a liability wrapper, which protects its members. This is an interesting option, especially for organizations willing to operate within the United States and give up some kind of decentralization. Within the U.S., you have a few options for which state to incorporate in.


### **2.1. Model Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC) Vermont and Delaware LLC**

The first step in this direction in Anglo-American law has already been taken in 2018 by the state of Vermont in the United States. Since mid-2018, it has been possible to establish a so-called Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC) in Vermont, which has now opened up the possibility of establishing a limited liability DAO for the first time.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn9">9</a></sup>  For this purpose, a Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC)<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn10">10</a></sup> was registered in Vermont after the deployment of the DAO on the Ethereum Blockchain by dOrg.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn11">11</a></sup> By linking the DAO to this BBLLC, the DAO has an official legal status that allows it to enter into contractual agreements and offer liability protection to participants.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn12">12</a></sup> The BBLLC enables full governance via the blockchain and using smart contracts.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn13">13</a></sup> OpenLaw in the U.S. state of Delaware is also taking a similar approach by establishing the LAO (Legal DAO).<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn14">14</a></sup> The LAO provides a legal structure to allow members to invest in blockchain-based projects in exchange for tokenized shares or utility tokens.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn15">15</a></sup>  This structure is called a "legal wrapper," which is created by structuring the DAO as an LLC to hold the company responsible for contracts, taxes, and violations of law, but not the individuals acting on behalf of that company.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn16">16</a></sup> The goal of the LAO is to limit the liability of the participants, provide clarity on the applicable law, and provide tax benefits (flowthrough/single taxation).


### **2.2. Model Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement DAO LLC**

On April 21, 2021, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon signed Bill 38, which allows Wyoming to recognize decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as limited liability companies. The new law is essentially an amendment to the current Wyoming Limited Liability Company Act. Under the provisions of the Act, a DAO is defined as a limited liability company whose articles of incorporation include a statement that the company is a DAO.<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn17”>17</a></sup> Concerning decision-making in a DAO, the notion of a majority of members is also concretized. Namely as the approval of more than fifty percent (50%) of the participating member interests in a vote in which a quorum of 4 members participates.<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn18”>18</a></sup> It is also interesting to note that a membership interest is determined as a member’s ownership share in a member-led decentralized autonomous organization, which may be defined in the entity’s charter, smart contract, or operating agreement.<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn19”>19</a></sup> The use of the term “ownership share” indicates a corporate reference and thus also suggests a classification as a security, even though this is not explicitly addressed in the bill.


### **2.3. Conclusion**

The option of using a liability wrapper in the U.S. is the best option for DAOs, which look for the most legal certainty and safety and are willing to comply with all the necessary regulations and provisions of the different states. Also, as mentioned, if the DAO decides to give out the token, it needs to be carefully looked at, because in most cases, it will be qualified as a security with the corresponding legal necessities (prospect, registration with the SEC, etc.)

Within the different options in Vermont, Delaware, and Wyoming, the choice depends on every individual case and the goals of the DAO and its community. While Wyoming’s law is most true to the DAO structure, it also requires the most information and paperwork, as explained. For comparison, in Delaware, the setup of the LLC is quite fast and cheap and provides a lot of flexibility. But it also requires that every Member of the DAO needs to be a member of the LLC, and each time a member changes, this would need to be updated. To go into too much detail here which states fit which structure would go beyond the scope of this paper, and require legal advice in each case, but in summary, the option of a US LLC is particularly suitable for projects that want the greatest security and are willing to comply with the numerous legal requirements.


## **3. Setting up a DAO as a Foundation**

A foundation with legal capacity under private law is an organization set up by one or more founders to permanently fulfill a purpose defined by the founder with the help of the assets dedicated to the foundation.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn33">33</a></sup>  In this respect, the foundation form could be considered to pack DAOs into a legal construct. 


### **3.1. General structure**

In principle, certain parallels between blockchain organizations and foundation law can be seen. The immutability principle, which is intrinsic to a Blockchain and on which trust in it is based, is similarly found in the solidification principle under foundation law. This principle states that it is not possible to update the founder’s intentions after the foundation has been established. In both cases, changes are only possible under increased conditions.


### **3.2. Swiss Foundation and Cayman Islands Foundation Company**

The most used jurisdictions are Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. Switzerland provides a more flexible foundation model with a relatively easy setup and a quite moderate taxation compared to other European jurisdictions.

Contrary to full decentralization, it needs to be highlighted that every foundation must have at least one Director, Supervisor, and Secretary. These can be natural persons or legal entities, and the same entity can be both Director and Secretary if desired.


### **3.3. Conclusion**

As a result, fully decentralized DAOs will have difficulties setting up a foundation given the legal boundaries. But attention should also be drawn to the many parallels between DAOs and the foundation structure, such as the high degree of autonomy and the permanent perpetuation so that corresponding considerations by legislators to adapt the foundation would be desirable. Until then, the structure is suitable for DAOs, which are willing to give up some decentralization and can designate trusted representatives.


## **4. Combinations of the different options**

Especially regarding the last option with an offshore foundation, a lot of projects combine this with an LLC or similar legal entity in a business-friendly jurisdiction, which employs the developers and the team, if there is one, as this can be difficult just with the foundation. Mostly, the foundation will hold the treasury and will have an agreement with the LLC in which it states that the DAO Treasury will pay for the expenses of the LLC. Although this option can use the benefits of options two and three, it also comes with additional requirements and certain centralization aspects, which need to be considered regarding the structure.


## Summary

As shown, there is no “perfect,” and no one fits all solution for DAOs.<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn40”>40</a></sup> Until a proper legal framework for DAOs is created, which enables them to operate fully decentralized with limited liability legal recognition and easy taxation,<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn41”>41</a></sup> every current legal setup comes with its benefits and downsides, and each DAO should seek individual legal advice, which option fits the best for its needs. Especially when a DAO Token is involved, the legal setup can get even more complicated, as a Token can often be qualified as security<sup><a href= “https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn42”>42</a></sup> and create additional legal requirements, such as prospects or registration with the legal authorities.
