Bankless started in 2019 as a newsletter, added a podcast in 2020, and in 2021 is now a self-sustaining media company dedicated to democratizing access to information about the world of decentralized finance. The role of Bankless is to operate as a public good for education, media, and culture on crypto and all other bankless technologies that are being introduced into the world.


## **Mission statement: [Mission (bankless.community)](https://www.bankless.community/mission)**


### **The bankless movement is ready to grow out of the hands of the few and into the hands of the many.**

*The bankless message is a global banner, and the Bankless DAO is the organization that coordinates people under this banner. Only an internet-native organization is capable of growing an internet-scaled revolution, and thus we need a Bankless DAO to grow the bankless revolution.*

*We want a money system by the people and for the people.*

*We want to propagate crypto media and culture.*

*We want to help the world go bankless.*

*Help grow the world’s first-ever media and culture DAO. Bring your talents, time, and ideas. Join the revolution.*

**Season Plan**

The Season Plan is a cyclical schedule for BankessDAO’s development and financial planning. Each Season lasts for 3 months, parallel to the natural quarter in reality, and progresses at a fixed pace.

The purpose of the Season is to define collective priorities, to gather energy, and to increase clarity; Season is also important in terms of community incentives and economic systems. At the beginning of each season, a budget is allocated and funding is provided for four different types of activities (this part is more important and longer, so it will be analyzed in detail in the third section on the economic system)

Bankless DAO is organized into 13 [guilds](https://www.notion.so/bankless/What-are-Guilds-and-How-do-I-Join-480beb1cdd35401d97b6d93ef6cf46ec). These guilds are talent pools and represent different competencies available for other members of the DAO to join or tap into—writers, developers, analytics, design, legal, etc.

Each guild has its own [budget](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/QmeUcnL5FTpF2ah2CCph6DZGqJzG19coT9b3ECLAvBxPH2) to allocate as they see fit.

Guilds quickly grasped the advantage of having their own capital pools instead of relying on a central flow from the grants committee and have begun to find ways to bring capital flows into their multisigs.

So far, we’ve already seen the marketing guild standardize pricing for Twitter campaigns.

Thinking further along here, DAOs as economic engines are a useful framing for rethinking [cost centers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cost-center.asp) with an organization. Take, for example, _First Quest_. First Quest is Bankless DAO’s onboarding project.

Members drop into the Discord server and go through a series of “quests” that briefly contextualizes Bankless DAO’s mission, culture, tools, and operations.


<img width="514" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893804-3e54b96d-134d-460b-9356-8b7e25d2e1db.png">
<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893816-d2e41f6c-ada9-4b97-b516-82d5d82d1230.png">
Discord onboarding in Bankless DAO

Eventually, going through _First Quest _will lead directly to a guild workstream. Like a funnel with multiple outlets, new members can find a guild they most resonate with and jump directly into a guild-specific first quest. For example, the [writers guild's first quest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qmaoGRhFlK6jdfkE8pZtn1LmqVSzpwxFlHvpZ-xDaEI/edit#) would be to complete an editing or writing task to gauge competency and familiarize new members with how the writers guild operates.


<img width="499" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893833-8b5da597-f3f8-4323-ac00-4d45a0b4ec5f.png">



Let’s take the Writers’ Union as an example. This is a group of writers who continuously output articles or organize newsletters according to the needs of the DAO. But they’re not satisfied with just that, they’ve been working on all kinds of things. Recently, for example, they’ve been putting together articles for Argent Wallet’s DeFi feature page, charging per article. You read that right, these guys are out getting work -_-


### Unions 
Since the vast majority of members are part-time, almost all roles are shared by multiple individuals. The union is the most active presence in the entire DAO, and most of the members of the operating union have a high level of authority throughout the DAO, but this authority does not come from a power structure defined by rules, but from their professionalism, understanding and familiarity with the DAO, their significant time commitment, and the constant help they give to their members.

The operating union is actually equal to the management support and back-office support of the entire DAO. This part of the responsibility also exists in the form of a union, which also follows the standard union rules and is open to all to join.

The specific responsibilities of the Operations Union include:



* Coordinating the day-to-day affairs and ensuring that the entire DAO runs smoothly and with a common goal.
* Overseeing the day-to-day activities of the DAO and keeping everyone aligned with the vision
* Facilitating the smooth and rapid functioning of all other aspects of DAO’s capabilities
* Facilitate core operations, people, budgets and goals, project delivery, and strategy
* Supports all of DAO’s functions working together


#### **Decentralization and Resilience**

The main benefit of moving from centralized to decentralized capital flows is… decentralization! Creating an economic engine will ultimately reduce reliance on centralized intermediaries, like a grants committee.

Transitioning to distributed capital flows also creates a resilient economic structure, not reliant on a centralized source of funding, susceptible to corruption, bottlenecks, and inefficient practices. 

As an added benefit, each instance of distributing capital to smaller pools, such as to each of the 13 guilds, creates experiments that run in parallel. Each guild has evolved to use their capital pools in their own ways and the best practices have cross-pollinated, which further increases resilience across the DAO.


## Social DAO: [Friends With Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/)


### MANIFESTO


### FWB is the intersection of our favorite technology and culture communities.

We are a collective of unique individuals pushing for a bright future. A world in which prosperity is abundant and technology acts as a communal connective tissue. We believe in a web3 world, where data and payments are fluid and controlled by the creators. We believe in the pursuit of open knowledge for the greater good. The tools for connecting the dots are finally here.

Technology is constantly evolving and blockchain technology, a fluid and open system, is suited to help us catalyze change. Friends With Benefits are creators, rebels, artists, thinkers, and doers forming an organization to discuss and shape that future. By gathering those looking to create change, Friends With Benefits aims to take these new tools and help implement web3 in a multitude of ways.

By unifying our community through a social token - [$FWB](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7d91e637589ec3bb54d8213a9e92dc6e8d12da91) - members can be confident that everyone in the group has shared skin in the game. By teasing the future of token-permissioned access, Friends With Benefits strives to showcase how a community can reach scale without diminishing quality along the way.

FWB has quickly become one of the most exciting social experiments on the internet.

[Friends with Benefits](https://fwb.help/) started as a private Discord server populated by our favorite thinkers and has since evolved into a global community bound together by shared values, shared incentives ([$FWB](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits-pro)) and shared IRL + URL experiences – all at the intersection of culture and crypto.



* FWB was created by a core instigator who had a vision and began inviting close friends to a Discord.
* As friends brought more friends in, certain contributors began to step up and play lead roles to support growth.
* Those contributors became the first layer of Staff, incentivized by responsibility, status, and token grants.
* The group gradually transitioned to a DAO to manage a community treasury.
* Opportunities to get involved began to plateau as primary functions became filled and weren’t set up to scale.
* More one-off projects were proposed, but became difficult to manage.

As we move forward, FWB as a whole will be defined by the strength and interdependence of its local parts.

For Season 4, FWB is excited to introduce [FWB Local](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmbTDzk6DdH8wB32o2RkTGXNKpZtQhgeBGpXwBwLdWwq9Q): a new token threshold that will allow community members holding 5 $FWB or more to participate in FWB Cities and FWB Events.

**Cities:**

FWB has established three Cities — London, New York, and Los Angeles — as the originating sub-DAOs within the FWB ecosystem, with more on the horizon.

These Cities have come together, elected their own leadership, and are building the blueprint for what FWB means on a local level.

From hosting local dinners to partnering with spaces and cafes as coworking spaces, to pooling capital to invest in local initiatives, the possibilities behind our Cities are endless.

Holding 5 $FWB grants access to all of our Cities giving members a sense of belonging wherever one travels.

We believe the strongest onramp into FWB is through participating in local community.

Additionally, the FWB Local tier will grant access to all FWB #cities channels, wherein members can connect with friends in their respective areas, whether they’re at home or traveling.

From: [Investing in Friends With Benefits (a DAO) - Andreessen Horowitz (a16z.com)](https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/) 

Until recently, DAOs were used mostly to secure DeFi protocols, and DAO members consisted primarily of highly technical contributors. [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/) (Friends With Benefits) represents a new kind of DAO. Founded initially as a token-gated Discord server, FWB has become the de facto home of web3’s growing creative class. Joining FWB requires a written application, which the community itself reviews and votes on, as well as a minimum buy-in of $FWB tokens, which represent meaningful ownership in the DAO. In addition to capturing the upside of the DAO’s creative output, the tokens come with governing power over a community treasury. By aligning the incentives of the next generation of artists, creators, and builders, FWB is enabling a different kind of renaissance for the next evolution of the internet. Fittingly, they describe themselves as a digital city.

Since its humble beginnings as a social experiment in September 2020, FWB has grown to nearly 2000 members and its community has driven an outsized portion of the cultural value in web3. DAO members have launched a (now canonical)[ token-gated events app](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s), [an NFT gallery](https://gallery.fwb.help/), a web3-focused [editorial venture](https://www.fwb.help/wip), a virtual music studio, and a [real-time community dashboard](https://www.fwb.help/pulse), in addition to a series of [parties](https://www.fwb.help/wip/fwb-paris) around the world. Their next venture, FWB Cities, aims to scale the DAO’s IRL footprint, partnering with city-specific spaces, communities, and experiences to bring real world benefits to the FWB membership. In this way, FWB Cities offers a glimpse into the very first IRL metaverse and will make the entry fee even more accessible to more people.

Because of FWB, it’s now possible to envision a world where the first time you interact with crypto is when you walk into a bar or attend your friend’s concert. Our goal is to offer guidance as FWB navigates the complexities that come with the next phase of DAO maturity. We plan to actively [participate in governance](https://a16z.com/2021/08/26/open-sourcing-our-token-delegate-program/) and we will empower key community members through delegation. We’re thrilled to be a part of the FWB community as they lead the charge toward mainstream adoption of web3.


## Aave Grants DAO



* [Aave Grants DAO | Aave Improvement Proposals](https://aave.github.io/aip/AIP-17/)
* [Aave Ecosystem Grants. Today we’re announcing the launch of… | by David Truong | Aave Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/aave/aave-ecosystem-grants-88260ede1485)
* [Aave Ecosystem Grants, Round 2. TL;DR: We’re continuing the Aave… | by David Truong | Aave Blog | Medium](https://medium.com/aave/aave-ecosystem-grants-round-2-33e7ffed7933)
* [Latest Aave Grants DAO topics - Aave](https://governance.aave.com/c/developers/25)

Aave has an ecosystem reserve of $1.2B or 2.7m AAVE as of 4/27/21, which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which could be used to fund grants. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals.

To promote inclusivity and a more visible and transparent avenue for funding development in the Aave ecosystem, while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, we propose a community-led grants program called Aave Grants DAO.

The goal of the program is to provide resources to grow the Aave ecosystem in a way that can scale over time. There are many great ideas for improving the Aave protocol bubbling up in the Discord, community forum and other places. We hope to initiate a community-led, transparent process for connecting those developers/creators/innovators with resources needed to go from idea to funded development.

Given the difficulty of decentralizing grants administration, we propose establishing a committee which has the power to administer grants on a discretionary basis. The focus will be on disbursing grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to improve the Aave ecosystem.

We propose a committee of 8 members: 1 lead and 7 reviewers. The lead will be the organizational backbone of the program and ensure that things move smoothly and efficiently. The lead will likely dedicate a significant amount of time to the program.

Reviewers will process applications, ensure that the lead is acting in good faith and is effective in their role, and will operate a 4 of 7 multisig which disburses funds to grantees. The reviewers will also hold the program accountable to its goals and objectives and return any excess funds to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Reviewers are likely to dedicate a smaller amount of time to the program.


### **Budget**

We request a max grants budget of $2m to distribute grants and a max operating budget of $250k over two quarters to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. This will be funded by the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.

Payments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made at the end of every month (i.e., if the program begins on 4/30/21, the lead will be paid on 5/30/21, and the again on 6/30/21 and 7/30/21 based on hours worked). Payments to reviewers will also be made every month based on hours worked.

Any changes to the AGD including renewal of the program at the end of 2 quarters, total quarterly budget and committee compensation will require full quorum.


### **Committee Compensation**

We suggest compensation for the lead roughly in line with the initial Uniswap and Compound proposals - $100/hr for a maximum of 40 hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the AGD multisig from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve as part of the overall funding for the program.

The time commitment for the reviewers is likely to be far lower. The compensation for reviewers will be $100/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.


### **Priorities**

To help inform the types of grants which are most likely to get funded, we highlight the following target areas:



1. Protocol development (including core Aave protocol development, development of higher layer protocols which use the Aave protocol)
2. Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications that use the Aave protocol)
3. Developer tooling
4. Community (marketing and educational)
5. Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem
6. Code audits
7. Events and hackathons
8. Bounties

### MakerDAO Ponders the Unthinkable as Members Debate Incorporation and Paying Taxes

Should DAOs pay taxes? And, if so: Where?

There’s a conversation underway in MakerDAO about how it should relate to the governments of the world, which has implications for the whole DeFi industry. In short, people are talking about whether or not MakerDAO should find a way to pay its taxes.

“I don’t think anyone here has the money to pay the IRS if they decide that Maker is a U.S. entity and decide to treat as income the $400+ million batch of tokens provided by the Foundation,” pseudonymous MakerDAO forum user PaperImperium [wrote](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-the-dao-needs-a-serious-discussion-about-legal-structure/10764/21).  

“My understanding is the only way around this is simply that Maker itself meet any claimed obligations,” the user continued. ”The first level of compliance is paying taxes — preferably in a single jurisdiction we choose now and not half a dozen that decide they can pick on a stateless DAO.” 


<img width="478" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147893946-adf48f7c-ff63-43e3-904e-c29db38b9280.png">



In[ a post](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-the-dao-needs-a-serious-discussion-about-legal-structure/10764) that kicked off the conversation for MakerDAO, PaperImperium wrote:

“MakerDAO currently has no legal structure registered in any jurisdiction, notwithstanding the dissolving Maker Foundation and the Dai Foundation. In the U.S., we are almost certainly likely to be classified as a general partnership, which we urgently need an answer for.” 

A general partnership is a legal identity that the U.S. imposes on an organization if it hasn’t otherwise registered itself in another category. PaperImperium finds this arrangement particularly problematic for the MakerDAO in light of potential tax obligations.

“US history has many examples of a single member of a general partnership being forced to pay the entire tax burden of their partners,” 

“Given the current political climate in the U.S., desire to increase spending, and growing worry over how to pay for that, I cannot foresee Maker — which pays taxes exactly nowhere – escaping notice, perhaps in multiple jurisdictions at once,” he wrote.

Wouter Kampmann, team lead from another core unit, chimed in to say that he agreed it was a conversation whose time has come, but he also drew a line in the sand.

“We need to step up our legal strategy efforts,” Kampmann[ wrote](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/discussion-the-dao-needs-a-serious-discussion-about-legal-structure/10764/16), but he also wanted to push his colleagues to stick to their principles.”Panic is rarely a good adviser.”


#### Emergency Shutdown

Noting that the digital era already makes total surveillance a reality and a future where most transactions occur with stablecoins only make it more so, he urged his fellow members of the DAO to take a stand for DAI as an alternative.

“For me there is one important thing we should keep in mind when considering these matters: Any path that leads to legal AML/KYC requirements on the Dai token itself, should be a non-starter.”

In fact, if the DAO finds itself forced to add those features, Kampmann suggested the best move would be to trigger [emergency shutdown](https://blog.makerdao.com/introduction-to-emergency-shutdown-in-multi-collateral-dai/) and simply dissolve the project.

## **How can a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) be legally structured?**

Will be our guest in the DAO Pioneer call on Friday 03.12.!

## **1. DAOs without a registered legal entity**

The first option, which is used a lot through the DeFi- Ecosystem, is not setting up a legal entity at all and trying to create a fully decentralized structure. However, this does not mean that DAOs without a registered legal entity operate outside the law. In most jurisdictions, they will be seen as general partnerships with the corresponding legal consequences. This most significant one is the risk of the personal liability of every participant. But this means also the DAO has a legal personality and can in most jurisdictions legally own assets and also employ people. Although the participants did not register the DAO, they created a fully recognized legal entity in most jurisdictions that can sue and can be sued. This is often misunderstood.

Although this bears significant risks, as mentioned. This structure also takes advantage of regulatory arbitrage in certain areas. If there is no central entity involved and the project is truly decentralized and launched anonymous legal enforcement becomes pretty difficult. Even the SEC acknowledged, that the greater a project’s decentralization, the less likely the underlying tokens would be considered securities.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn8">8</a></sup>


## **2. Setting up a DAO with a liability wrapper or as a DAO LLC**

The second option is setting up a DAO with a liability wrapper, which protects its members. This is an interesting option, especially for organizations willing to operate within the United States and give up some kind of decentralization. Within the US, you have a few options for which state to incorporate in.


### **2.1. Model Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC) Vermont and Delaware LLC**

The first step in this direction in Anglo-American law has already been taken in 2018 by the state of Vermont in the United States. Since mid-2018, it has been possible to establish a so-called Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC) in Vermont, which has now opened up the possibility of establishing a limited liability DAO for the first time.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn9">9</a></sup>  For this purpose, a Blockchain-Based Limited Liability Company (BBLLC)<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn10">10</a></sup> was registered in Vermont after the deployment of the DAO on the Ethereum Blockchain by dOrg.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn11">11</a></sup> By linking the DAO to this BBLLC, the DAO has an official legal status that allows it to enter into contractual agreements and offer liability protection to participants.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn12">12</a></sup> The BBLLC enables full governance via the blockchain and using smart contracts.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn13">13</a></sup> OpenLaw in the U.S. state of Delaware is also taking a similar approach by establishing the LAO (Legal DAO).<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn14">14</a></sup> The LAO provides a legal structure to allow members to invest in blockchain-based projects in exchange for tokenized shares or utility tokens.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn15">15</a></sup>  This structure is called a "legal wrapper," which is created by structuring the DAO as an LLC to hold the company responsible for contracts, taxes, and violations of law, but not the individuals acting on behalf of that company.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn16">16</a></sup> The goal of the LAO is to limit the liability of the participants, provide clarity on the applicable law, and provide tax benefits (flowthrough/single taxation).


### **2.2. Model Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement DAO LLC**

On April 21, 2021, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon signed Bill 38, which allows Wyoming to recognize decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) as limited liability companies. The new law is essentially an amendment to the current Wyoming Limited Liability Company Act. Under the provisions of the Act, a DAO is defined as a limited liability company whose articles of incorporation include a statement that the company is a DAO.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn17">17</a></sup> Concerning decision-making in a DAO, the notion of a majority of members is also concretized. Namely as the approval of more than fifty percent (50%) of the participating member interests in a vote in which a quorum of 4 members participates.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn18">18</a></sup> It is also interesting to note that a membership interest is determined as a member's ownership share in a member-led decentralized autonomous organization, which may be defined in the entity's charter, smart contract, or operating agreement.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn19">19</a></sup> The use of the term "ownership share" indicates a corporate reference and thus also suggests a classification as a security, even though this is not explicitly addressed in the bill.


### **2.3. Conclusion**

The option of using a liability wrapper in the US is the best option for DAOs, which look for the most legal certainty and safety and are willing to comply with all the necessary regulations and provisions of the different states. Also, as mentioned, if the DAO decides to give out the token it needs to be carefully looked at, because in most cases it will be qualified as a security with the corresponding legal necessities (prospect, registration with the SEC, etc.)

Within the different options in Vermont, Delaware and Wyoming, the choice depends on every individual case and the goals of the DAO and its community. While Wyoming's law is most true to the DAO structure, it also requires the most information and paperwork, as explained. For Comparison in Delaware, the setup of the LLC is quite fast and cheap and provides a lot of flexibility. But it also requires that every Member of the DAO needs to be a member of the LLC and each time a member changes this would need to be updated. To go into too much detail here which states fit which structure would go beyond the scope of this paper, and require legal advice in each case, but in summary, the option of a US LLC is particularly suitable for projects that want the greatest security and are willing to comply with the numerous legal requirements.


## **3. Setting up a DAO as a Foundation**

A foundation with legal capacity under private law is an organization set up by one or more founders to permanently fulfill a purpose defined by the founder with the help of the assets dedicated to the foundation.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn33">33</a></sup>  In this respect, the foundation form could be considered to pack DAOs into a legal construct. 


### **3.1. General structure**

In principle, certain parallels between blockchain organizations and foundation law can be seen. The immutability principle, which is intrinsic to a Blockchain and on which trust in it is based, is similarly found in the solidification principle under foundation law.  This principle states that it is not possible to update the founder's intentions after the foundation has been established.  In both cases, changes are only possible under increased conditions.


### **3.2. Swiss Foundation and Cayman Islands Foundation Company**

The most used jurisdictions are Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. Switzerland provides in comparison to other European jurisdictions a more flexible foundation model with a relatively easy setup and a quite moderate taxation.

It needs to be highlighted, contrary to full decentralization every foundation must have at least one Director, Supervisor, and Secretary. These can be natural persons or legal entities, and the same entity can be both Director and Secretary if desired.


### **3.3. Conclusion**

As a result, fully decentralized DAOs will have difficulties setting up a foundation given the legal boundaries. But attention should also be drawn to the many parallels between DAOs and the foundation structure, such as the high degree of autonomy and the permanent perpetuation so that corresponding considerations by legislators to adapt the foundation would be desirable. Until then, the structure is suitable for DAOs, which are willing to give up some decentralization and can designate trusted representatives.


## **4. Combinations of the different options**

Especially regarding the last option with an offshore foundation, a lot of projects combine this with an LLC or similar legal entity in a business-friendly jurisdiction, which employs the developers and the team, if there is one, as this can be difficult just with the foundation. Mostly, the foundation will hold the treasury and will have an agreement with the LLC in which it states, that the DAO Treasury will pay for the expenses of the LLC. Although this option can use the benefits of options two and three, it also comes with additional requirements and certain centralization aspects, which need to be considered regarding the structure.


## Summary

As shown, there is no “perfect” and no onefitsall solution for DAOs.<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn40">40</a></sup> Until a proper legal framework for DAOs is created, which enables them to operate fully decentralized with limited liability legal recognition and easy taxation,<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn41">41</a></sup> every current legal setup comes with its benefits and downsides and each DAO should seek individual legal advice, which option fits the best for its needs. Especially when a DAO Token is involved, the legal setup can get even more complicated, as a Token can often be qualified as a security<sup><a href="https://lrz.legal/en/the-legal-revolutionary/law-in-the-digital-economy/how-can-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao-be-legally-structured#_ftn42">42</a></sup> and create additional legal requirements, such as prospects or registration with the legal authorities.


## The following texts taken from: 
[Mapping the Future of Legal Personality · MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu/pub/mappingthefutureoflegalpersonality/release/1)

Prior to discussing the features of DAOs that call for legal recognition, we will provide a range of interpretations and issues with each of these core features.


### **A. Decentralization**

Various points of centralization are frequently implicitly accepted or disregarded. For instance, most proposed DLT solutions operate on existing Internet infrastructure, which has various points of centralization (including, for example, Domain Name System infrastructure). Furthermore, beyond the management of digital assets with no real-world counterpart, most systems have to interact with the physical world where decentralization is hard, if not impossible, to achieve. Often, the physical real-world involves centralized players and entities, be it jurisdictions, legal entities, individuals or Internet-connected devices which do not provide immutable truths nor guaranteed execution of processes. Therefore, decentralization is not of a (crisp) binary nature as many purport it to be, but is rather a multivariate measure that may range from fully centralized to fully decentralized.


### **B. Autonomous**

The notion of autonomy, especially when applied to autonomous agents, refers to behavior without undue external interference. In other contexts, the use of the term assumes a degree of intelligence in how behavioral decisions are undertaken, and an internalized notion of maximizing ones self-interest. In contrast, the use of the term in the context of the original DAO refers to the automated nature of intermediation between the participating parties and behavior of the entity as a whole, similar to how a body attains autonomy through the aggregation of its constituent parts. As with the case of decentralization, the complexity of the logic specifying the nature of autonomy and the degree of internal representation of purpose or goal may range from simple branching logic to complex, artificially intelligent agents.


### **C. Organization**

The third distinguishing feature of DAOs is that they are an organization made up of participating parties. Although the underlying technology typically acts as an enabler of organizational behavior by providing — for instance, protocols through which decisions may be taken and carried out — in some DAOs, one may consider technological components as entities or parties forming the organization itself. For instance, such a system may effectively act as an algorithmic trader independent of the human parties themselves. Similarly, components of a DAO providing compliance functions may be seen as parties in the organization with a specific role. Given the spirit in which many DAOs have been created — basing their design on that of public and permissionless DLTs, with parties corresponding to equal peers acting as part of a network — one typically finds flat organizations in which the parties have similar rights of participation. However, this is not necessarily the case, and the automated nature of the decision-taking protocol may (and has been) leveraged for an arbitrarily fine-grained way of taking decisions. This organizational decision-taking protocol can, in fact, be argued to be a distinguishing feature of such organizations.

### **Legal Personalities:**

As a construct, legal personality exists as a type of exchange — certain legal protections are granted in favor of a certification of compliance with some governing rule.


#### **_Name_**

Every legal organization is required to have a name so that it is able to be identified and distinguished from other organizations and even from the people involved in it.


#### **_Address_**

Every legal organization is required to have a registered office, or place of incorporation. Current laws have recognized that the seat of incorporation or registered office could differ from the principal place of business. 


#### **_Purposes_**

Legal organizations require an intent and purpose. The purpose must be lawful and consistent with public policy. The same would apply to software if it was to have legal personality. The purposes can be multiple and varied, ranging from charity to commerce, or from passive holding to active trading.The purpose should be explicit and clear.

**_Capital_**

For certain legal organizations, capital is a central feature. Typically, company law, focused on trading contexts centers on capital, including the raising and retention of capital, as well as insolvency considerations. In the digital context, this leads to an interesting question: how should the role of capital be addressed if the core asset of ITAs is software?

**_Governance_**

This point is where traditional organizations diverge from DAOs and ITAs. Traditional legal organizations have a board of governors. ITAs, on the other hand, currently are not required to have a certain body of governance, though it is worth noting that as a practical matter ITAs indeed do have governance mechanisms.

The direction automated governance is taking to date suggests a need to balance between the varying levels of human support and the need to uphold the integrity of the design. 

With the knowledge of how liability currently operates, there should be clear distinctions between the responsibilities of the decentralized, automated, and human-specific interactions. This will ensure that humans involved with ITAs carry out designated and defined functionalities, and, importantly, are not liable for situations that extend beyond their own engagements.


#### **_Ownership and control_**

Typically with centralized organizations, ownership is vested in identifiable persons. For charitable foundations, however, the requirement of private owners is not necessary. Instead, there are identifiable controllers, featured in legal organizations as administrators.


#### **_ Patrimony_**

Every legal person has a distinct patrimony, which includes everything one owns, as well as intangible rights. Creating a legal organization confers an organizational right to patrimony in such a way that the patrimony of an organization then includes the tangible and intangible ownership interests of the organization. For an organization represented as a technology, the principle is much the same but merits additional discussion.


### ** Conclusion**

Just as other forms of legal personality have been granted to non-human entities, there should be a new form of legal personality for DAOs. Existing literature has demonstrated that certain rights are required for certain protections.

Granting a DAO legal protections would have obvious benefits, including: 1) bringing transparency to a process that has been stained with opacity and confusion, 2) enabling new forms of businesses to provide new types of value to consumers, 3) ushering in a new era of economic resilience, 4) and creating regulatory frameworks that are as efficient as the technologies they seek to regulate. While such an idea is transformational, it is not without risk. Absent basic protections and safeguards, these new technologies could create more problems than they solve.

The question then becomes, how do we create a new type of container for legal personality that encapsulates all of the good these technologies are capable of and none of the bad? As outlined in this paper, the two-fold answer is based on the notion of a basic exchange. Certain rights and assurances are provided in favor of certain protections. 

First, we must define these new legal persons. In our case, we are talking about organizations that have traditionally existed under corporations law. However, a distinction here is critical. The organizations we are describing have certain qualifying characteristics, particularly related to governance, that need to be specified in such a way that preserves both trust and flexibility.

For new, technology-enabled business organizations, the aim should be to better manage risk through limitations of liability that can be granted through the state. Corporations law the world round requires a similar set of features in order for the associated protections, including name, address, purpose, capital, governance, ownership and control, patrimony, winding up, regulation, and registration.

As these new technologically-enabled organizations operate using a structure that enables them to do things that classic organizations simply cannot, the most astute regulators looking at these new forms of legal personality will not only catalog those foundational characteristics of legal personality that are required for these new entities, but will also leverage the natural abilities of the unique ability of these new technologies. In the case of DAOs, this would include a transparent and accurate list of different records that are maintained, specification of governance protocols, acknowledgment of the opportunities to preserve trust offered by new technologies, and a recognition of those areas requiring further accountability.

Blockchain and DAOs are exciting because they represent an opportunity to revisit the way society itself is organized; in the same way, they are scary because of the unknowns associated with how these new technologies will fit into the world around us. As a result, we are left with two choices. We can ignore this opportunity to act, remain content with the landscape as it is, or we can choose to try, learn, and do better.


## The Rise of Decentral Autonomous Organisations

From[ https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/rise-of-daos/release/1](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/rise-of-daos/release/1)

The ideal design of DAOs is still being explored, exposing challenging governance questions which may ultimately stymie their growth and development.undefined DAOs are not formally recognized and do not fit neatly into existing forms of business associations, making it difficult for DAOs to interact with traditional business entities and imposing personal risk on members.undefined In certain instances, interests in DAOs may be difficult to classify, raising regulatory concerns when it comes to securities laws.


<img width="524" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147894004-0a71d6c0-a68f-4103-8133-64dff2277c69.png">



_Participatory DAOs_ are being used to engage in traditional commercial endeavors—like venture capital financing—and are being explored to manage open source technology involving a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain.undefined

The latter form of _participatory DAO_ is perhaps the most significant. Smart contracts by their nature are hard to modify and change once deployed to a blockchain.undefined They are tamper-resistant and can be designed to be autonomous, creating regulatory challenges and making it difficult for users of the software to modify the smart contract if there is a bug, issue, or regulatory concern.

By relying on a DAO, the initial developers of the smart contract-based protocol can transfer ongoing decision-making to a disparate group of the software’s users and supporters. Members of these DAOs generally have the power to set parameters needed by the underlying smart contract and also have the ability to update the smart contract itself. Governance decisions occur through a vote measured by a “token” that is distributed to users of the smart contract, as well as the smart contract’s initial developers and sometimes those developers’ investors.

Beyond questions of governance, DAOs lack any formal legal recognition, creating potential liabilities for DAO members and exposing members to the organization’s liabilities and responsibilities. DAOs also remain outside of traditional systems, limiting the ability of these organizations to transact with more traditional legal enterprises.

One of the longstanding benefits of creating a legal entity, whether a corporation or limited liability company, is the ability to protect the personal assets of an organization’s owners from creditors. DAOs, by default, do not enjoy these benefits because the legal system does not recognize these structures—by default—as a legal entity eligible for a limited liability regime.

For instance, in the U.S., DAOs formed for the purpose of making a profit likely would be deemed a “general partnership” and consequently lack the ability to shield members’ assets if the organization injures a third-party or is unable to pay its creditors.undefined If characterized as a general partnership, DAOs may struggle to attract members, especially those with significant assets. Large businesses, institutional investors, and other regulated commercial entities may be reluctant to invest or otherwise support a DAO for fear that membership would put other assets at risk.
