# IOTA DAO Pioneers

We took inspiration from [Stephen Reid](http://stephenreid.net/) ([@daoist321](https://twitter.com/daoist321)) How to DAO course, but harmonized content and adjusted it to the needs of our IOTA community.


## Session 2 prep

Welcome to the second week. We want to use this second week to focus on the complex topic of voting and ‚Äúpower.‚Äù Explore many different approaches to establish ‚Äúfairness‚Äù in DAOs and Crypto projects and dive deep into the topic to understand the opportunities and the risks of the current voting/governance mechanisms out there.

_The elephant in the room: are we simply creating new plutocracies?_

Vitalik: On collusion

This is also why coin-based voting systems (like Bihu‚Äôs) have one major genuine advantage over identity-based systems (like the Gitcoin CLR or the /r/ethtrader donut experiment): at least there is no benefit to buying accounts en masse, because everything you do is proportional to how many coins you have, regardless of how many accounts the coins are split between.

However, mechanisms that do not rely on any model of identity and only rely on coins fundamentally cannot solve the problem of concentrated interests outcompeting dispersed communities trying to support public goods; an identity-free mechanism that empowers distributed communities cannot avoid over-empowering centralized plutocrats pretending to be distributed communities.

The ideal goal of an identity system is to make it relatively easy for individuals to get one identity but relatively difficult to get many identities. \
But identity, at least the way it has been implemented so far, is a fragile thing....

The technology now exists to allow one-person-one-vote voting:

Similar Ideas could be realized using the IOTA Identity Framework:

### Quadratic voting

‚ÄúUnder quadratic voting, each additional voice credit buys less voting power on an issue, making extreme views more expensive to express and compromise more likely. Individuals, therefore, are more willing to spend their voice credits on current, immediate issues instead of radical, unrealistic ones.‚Äù

### Vote delegation/liquid democracy



* [Liquid democracy - by Dom](https://medium.com/organizer-sandbox/liquid-democracy-true-democracy-for-the-21st-century-7c66f5e53b6f)

Liquid Democracy combines the advantages of Direct Democracy and Representative Democracy and creates a truly democratic voting system that empowers voters to either vote on issues directly or to delegate one‚Äôs voting power to a trusted party.

Through delegation, people with domain-specific knowledge can better influence the outcome of decisions, which in turn leads to overall better governance of the state. Because of this, Liquid Democracy naturally evolves into a Meritocracy, where decisions are mainly made by those who have the kind of knowledge and experience required to make well-informed decisions on issues.

Delegation is a sign of trust. A voter trusts a delegate to represent her on certain decisions. Suppose this trust is broken (by, for example, increasing ideological differences or corruption of the delegate). In that case, the voter can revoke the delegation and either vote personally or delegate someone else. As we will see later, this notion of provisional trust is essential to create a sense of responsibility and accountability for delegates.

<img width="274" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147869204-9226d361-0aed-47cc-a9d8-266a48b420b0.png">


What is missing from the above diagram is domain-specific delegation. A voter cannot only delegate her vote to a single delegate, but delegation can be made to various delegates that vote on behalf of the voter on domain-specific issues. Through such a system, experts can more likely positively influence the outcome of problems and lead to an overall better result.

* [Join the Council ¬∑ Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-join-council)
* [Voting for Councillors ¬∑ Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-vote-councillor)
* [A Walkthrough of Polkadot‚Äôs Governance](https://polkadot.network/a-walkthrough-of-polkadots-governance/)
* **Three different bodies have a say in the decision-making:** 
    * 1. Public referenda chamber, 
    * 2. The council, 
    * 3. The technical committee
* Every DOT holder can bring up public referendums, and every DOT holder can vote on them **weighted to the amount of DOT held. One token = 1 vote, but algorithms are in place that can lower or increase this.**

**Referendum:**



* To create a proposal, someone needs to **deposit a minimum amount of DOT**. To make a proposal successful. Others need to **support the proposal by depositing** at least the same amount of DOT towards the proposal. 
* The deposited tokens of the proposer and everyone that seconds the proposal will stay **locked until the proposal is brought up for a vote** and cannot be retrieved until the proposal is up for a vote **even if the proposal never gets into a voting state**
* At the end of every month, **the proposal with the most locked tokens** will be moved to the voting stage and **become a referendum**. All other submissions will have to wait until the end of the following month and continue to collect token support deposits to get a chance of being voted on.
* **Only the most successful proposal of every month will be moved to a public referendum vote** - the previously locked funds will be released back to all users who seconded the proposal and the proposal initiator.

**Referendum voting:**



* **The voting time for a referendum is 30 days (7 days in Kusama)**. At this time, DOT holders can deposit DOT in the vote for ‚ÄúYes or No‚Äù - these tokens are not locked directly, and it is possible to change your vote and opinion. **Counting of votes is done at the end of the 30 days,** and the **majority of deposited funds at this time decide the outcome of the vote**.
* It can only be voted at one referendum at a time, 30 days later the next one in queue follows (depending on how much DOT is seconded to it)


#### **The council:**



* The council currently consists of 13 members (planned to increase to 24). **Elected in a stake based voting by DOT holders**
* Along with [controlling the treasury](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-treasury), the council is called upon primarily for three tasks of governance: **proposing sensible referenda, canceling uncontroversially dangerous or malicious referenda, and electing the technical committee.**
* The council can propose referendums on its own, and those will be brought up to public voting. **Every month, the public voting switches between a public proposed referendum and a council proposed referendum**.

<img width="614" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147869237-4699bdd5-155b-4b76-84da-641dc25aa79e.png">



* The council **can cancel all public referendums with a majority of 2/3rd of the council members.**
* Council members are **chosen out of a set of candidates every six months** depending on how many tokens are deposited to vote by holders on the voting account of the council member. Voters can split their holdings over several candidates.


#### **The technical committee:**



* **Voted by the council**
* Can **veto and cancel all referendums** 
* Can **propose own emergency referendums**
* It consists of a team formed by the two companies that develop the Polkadot technology, **both owned by Gavin Wood, the founder of Polkadot**


#### **Polkadot treasury:**



* Funds can be requested through a proposal
* Minimum 5% of the requested funds or **minimum 100 DOT (around 2500 Dollars**) must be deposited to make a proposal.
    * This deposit is burned if the proposal is declined 
* Funding is granted by the **decision of the council**
* The Council ultimately controls the Treasury**, and how the funds will be spent is up to their judgment.**


### Voting techniques used:

**Tallying**

There are three different scenarios depending on which entity proposed the proposal and whether all council members voted yes. We can use the following table for reference.

<img width="653" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147869245-2cb9b721-3b90-43b4-aef7-0d3d6c735c9a.png">



**Super-Majority Approve[‚Äã](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#super-majority-approve)**

A positive turnout bias, whereby a heavy super-majority of aye votes is required to carry at low turnouts, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority-carries as below.

**Super-Majority Against[‚Äã](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#super-majority-against)**

A negative turnout bias, whereby a heavy super-majority of nay votes is required to reject at low turnouts, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority-carries as below.

**Simple-Majority[‚Äã](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#simple-majority)**

Majority-carries, a simple comparison of votes; if there are more aye votes than nay, then the proposal is carried, no matter how much stake votes on the proposal.

**The ‚Äúpower‚Äù of a vote depends on:**



* **amount of tokens** deposited into the vote by a voter
* **Chosen time (conviction) that these tokens will be locked** after the voting period is finished, creating a multiplier on the voting power. **The longer a vote is chosen to stay ‚Äúlocked‚Äù in the voting decision, the more times the number of deposited tokens will be multiplied**
* **Choosing to not at all lock your **deposited tokens gives your token amount a multiplier of 0,1 (**100 Tokens = ten votes**)
* **Choosing to lock your vote for eight days** after the voting period is finished gives you a multiplier of 1 (**100 Tokens = 100 votes**)
* **The maximum locking period is 256 days** which will produce a multiplier of 8 (**100 Tokens = 800 votes**)

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147869267-e60526e2-43c9-411c-929a-6e7f69ab3a3d.png">


**Delegating votes for referendum votings:**



* **Users can delegate** amounts of tokens to other users who should vote on their behalf and choose the conviction (locking time) for those delegated tokens. **The user that receives the delegation can then vote with the delegated tokens **and the locking period of the tokens he received from someone else.


#### **Adaptive Quorum Biasing[‚Äã](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#adaptive-quorum-biasing)**

Polkadot introduces a concept, ‚ÄúAdaptive Quorum Biasing‚Äù, which functions as a lever that the council can use to alter the effective super-majority required to make it easier or more difficult for a proposal to pass in the case that there is no clear majority of voting power backing it or against it.

<img width="510" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77154511/147869278-fb511efd-a668-48c4-a741-42cc61198295.png">



Let‚Äôs use the above image as an example.

If a publicly submitted referendum only has a 25% turnout, the tally of ‚Äúaye‚Äù votes has to reach 66% for it to pass since we applied Positive Turnout Bias.

In contrast, when it has a 75% turnout, the tally of ‚Äúaye‚Äù votes has to reach 54%, which means the super-majority required decreases as the turnout increases.

When the council proposes a new proposal through unanimous consent, the referendum would be put to the vote using ‚ÄúNegative Turnout Bias‚Äù. In this case, it is easier to pass this proposal with a low turnout and requires a super-majority to reject. As more token holders participate in voting, the bias approaches a plain majority carries.

Referring to the above image, when a referendum only has a 25% turnout, the tally of ‚Äúaye‚Äù votes has to reach 34% for it to pass.

In short, when the turnout rate is low, a super-majority is required to reject the proposal, which means a lower threshold of ‚Äúaye‚Äù votes has to be reached, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority.

All three tallying mechanisms - majority carries, super-majority approve, and super-majority against - equate to a simple majority-carries system at 100% turnout.


## Uniswap



* [Uniswap | Introducing UNI](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/)
* [Process | Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/governance/process)
* [Beginners Guide to Voting | Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/governance/guide-to-voting)
* [https://gov.uniswap.org](https://gov.uniswap.org)
* [Uniswap Interface](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote)
* [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap)


### How it works:



* UNI holders can either vote themself, or they delegate their voting rights to another address. Activating voting rights always needs a delegation (either you delegate to yourself or to someone else) to make voting possible.
* Users can suggest a protocol change by suggesting it in the UNI - governance forum in a so-called ‚Äútemperature check.‚Äù
* Users that like the proposed idea can support it by depositing UNI tokens in the ‚ÄúSnapshot‚Äù application. (off-chain voting tool)
* If a minimum of 25.000 UNI Votes (~625.000 Dollars) is deposited in a 3 days temperature check period for a ‚Äúyes‚Äù majority, the idea is moved into a decision-making process.
* The proposer needs to create a new thread in the forum and bring the topic forward as a ‚Äúproposal,‚Äù Several proposals will be presented to the UNI holders every week. Again, UNI holders need to support a proposal by depositing UNI tokens.
* After five days, the proposal with the most UNI tokens deposited (but a minimum of 50.000 UNI) wins the poll and can be moved forward to the next step.
* The 3rd step is a governance proposal. This represents the intention to change the protocol (smart contract) code. The proposer must submit the code changes and post the proposal now as a ‚Äúgovernance proposal.‚Äù To do this, the proposer needs a minimum of 10 million UNI (250 million USD) held or delegated in his address.
* The voting period is now seven days with a two days time lock for tokens in the vote. After these seven days are over, the majority decision gets executed (change the code or don't change the code)

Phase 1: Temperature Check ‚Äî Discourse/Snapshot

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.

To create a Temperature Check:



1. Ask a general, non-biased question to the community on [gov.uniswap.org 160](http://gov.uniswap.org/) about a potential change (example: ‚ÄúShould Uniswap governance add liquidity mining for XYZ token?‚Äù). Forum posts should be labeled as follows: ‚ÄúTemperature Check - [Your Title Here]‚Äù. The forum post should include a link to the associated Snapshot poll.
2. Voters use Snapshot to indicate their interest in bringing it forward to the next stage. Snapshot poll lengths should be set to 3 days.

UNI is a tradable asset and functions like most other standard ERC20 tokens, except it has a deeper power as a voting mechanism. In order for UNI to be used as a vote, the owner must first go through the delegation process. Delegating UNI binds the voting power of your tokens to an address so it may be used to vote. This address could be yourself or a trusted party who you believe will vote in the best interest of Uniswap Governance.

A democratic consensus, in our process called ‚Äúquorum‚Äù, is determined by the percentage of UNI tokens in favor of, or against, a proposal. 1% of all UNI must be cast in favor to submit a proposal, and 4% in order to pass a vote.
