## üå≥ IOTA DAO-Pioneers Initiative

The **IOTA DAO-Pioneers Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows with content and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://wiki.iota.org/learn/about-iota/an-introduction-to-iota) among each other for zero fees.

## üéØ Initiative Goals

The IOTA DAO-Pioneers Initiative is an active community learning experience.

We aim not to be teachers and students, but we aim to strengthen collective and collaborative learning in DAOs.

Our first learning circle has happened in the time frame between 8th November 2021 till 10th December 2021 and included regular live sessions in the IOTA Discord and discussions in the related #DAO-Pioneer discord channels.

Some facts from the first circle in november/december 2021:

- The First learning circle involved 486 Iota community members!

- We did 51 live sessions talking about DAOs and explored the provided learning materials together.

- A total of 15487 minutes of voice chat have happened during these sessions.

The following ressources are available from the first learning session:

- [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5joP0FyJQU4A9__Ulub29j6LC_wqy6ux) hosting the 5 Friday main grpup-chat sessions.

- [5 session documents](/session-documents/2021) including all knowledge and links to the covered topics.
